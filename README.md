# TDL-Project

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

## Running the tests

To run the tests, open the project on Spring Boot.  Right click on the project and select Coverage As -> JUnit Test.

### Unit Tests 
Unit tests are run to ensure that each 'unit' of an application is functioning as they are intended to.  These can be made for individual classes and a test should be made for all the methods and attributes that make up each class.  

### Integration Tests 
Integration tests are run to check that the communication between different objects is happening correctly.  For this TDL web application, a controller class is used to call the relevant service class.  Mock requests are made to the controller class to test the communication between controller and service.
